## What is dondelobusco?

dondelobusco is a web service that pretends to help people, that are currently buying something, to find their products faster by sending their request to all stores in real time.

## Motivation

I'm a software developer that always worked for projects that have been already started. I wanted to have the opportunity to build an entire site from the beggining and I also found a problem every time I went to stores to find something I want: the more specific the product you want to buy the more likely those stores wont have it, hence you have to go to the next store.
