## dondelobusco

> a platform to connect buyers with sellers in real time

## Motivation

I'm a software developer that always worked for projects that have been already started. I wanted to have the opportunity to build an entire site from the beggining and I also found a problem every time I went to stores to find something I want: the more specific the product you want to buy the more likely those stores wont have it, hence you have to go to the next store.

## What it is?

dondelobusco is a web service that pretends to help people, that are currently buying something, to find their products faster by sending their request to all stores in real time. At the same time it allows store admin to receive those queries and respond to them in real time with a dashboard that also has CRUD operations to build their own stores with products in this platform.
